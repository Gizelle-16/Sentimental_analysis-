This is a learning project, on Twitter sentimental analyisis. Used the sentiment140 dataset from kaggle, performed basic data pre-processing and used the logistic regression model with TF-IDF vectorzer. 

FOr some reason, the model.ipynb shows invalid, so I have added a colab file with the code to the model.ipynb, please refer to that.
